# Project Overview

This project focuses on developing Bash scripts to understand and practice loops, conditions, and parsing techniques. Each script performs specific tasks using various loop types and conditional statements.

## Technologies

- Bash scripting
- Linux environment

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Not allowed to use awk
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors
- The first line of all Bash scripts must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts must be a comment explaining what the script is doing

### Copyright - Plagiarism
- Solutions for tasks must be created independently to meet the learning objectives
- Plagiarism in any form is strictly forbidden
