## Project Overview
This project involves designing various web infrastructures, each with different levels of complexity and features. The goal is to understand the components and their interactions within a web stack, as well as addressing common issues such as single points of failure, security, and scalability.

## Technologies
- Nginx
- HAproxy
- MySQL
- SSL/TLS
- Firewalls
- Monitoring tools

## Requirements

### General
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Whiteboard each task, take a picture/screenshot, and upload it.
- Focus on the requirements, avoid unnecessary details.
