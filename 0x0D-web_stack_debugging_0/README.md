tack Debugging #0

## Project Overview
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!). This project focuses on getting Apache to run on a Docker container and to return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of it.
